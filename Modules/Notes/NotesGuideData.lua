Type item IDs in brackets:

[6948]

If the item is known or becomes cached, Read View will render it as an item link.

```
[6948]
[2589]
[17182]
```

## Centered Blocks [centered-blocks]

This text is centered
So is this line
And this one too
[/c]

Use:

```
[c]
Your centered lines here
[/c]
```

Centered blocks can also contain headers and atlas rows.

## Atlas Rows [atlas-rows]

[@atlas GarrMission_CurrentEncounter-Glow]
[@atlas GarrMission_CurrentEncounter-Glow 54x54]
[@atlas GarrMission_CurrentEncounter-Glow 32x32]

Use:

```
[@atlas GarrMission_CurrentEncounter-Glow]
[@atlas GarrMission_CurrentEncounter-Glow 54x54]
[@atlas GarrMission_CurrentEncounter-Glow 32x32]
```

If no size is provided, the atlas uses its native size.
If a size is provided, it uses that size.
Large atlases can clamp to the note width to avoid overflow.

Atlas tokens must be on their own line.

## Code Blocks [code-blocks]

```
# This stays literal

- This stays literal

[12345]

[@atlas GarrMission_CurrentEncounter-Glow]

**This also stays literal**
```

Code blocks render their contents literally and suppress all Notes formatting rules inside the block.

To show code block syntax inside a note add this above and below the intended contents:

```
 ```
```

(Back to Top)[top]
---

## Inline Code [inline-code]

`Code Line`

```
 `Inline Code`
```

Inline code renders as a small contained block and does not apply any other formatting inside it.

(Back to Top)[top]
---

## Notes About Read vs Edit [read-vs-edit]

Edit View always stores plain raw text only.

Read View is where formatting, links, and atlas rendering happen.

Your saved note text is never converted into formatted rich text.

(Back to Top)[top]
---

## Header Anchors And Jump Links [header-anchors-and-jump-links]

# Gear Setup [gear]

## Boss One [boss-1]

### Phase Two [phase-2]

(Jump to gear)[gear]
(Jump to boss one)[boss-1]
(Broken link example)[missing-anchor]

Anchor tokens only work on header lines and must be at the end of the line.

Valid anchor IDs use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

Read View hides the anchor token from the displayed header text.

Jump links only resolve inside the current note.

If a jump target is missing, the full link stays visible in red and does nothing.

Use:

```
# Gear Setup [gear]
## Boss One [boss-1]
### Phase Two [phase-2]

(Jump to gear)[gear]
(Jump to boss one)[boss-1]
(Broken link example)[missing-anchor]
```
(Back to Top)[top]
---

## External Note Links [external-note-links]

(Raid Prep)[[AJH23S]]
(Missing Note)[[INVALID]]

External note links open another saved note using its internal note ID.

If the note exists, the link is clickable in Read View.

If the note does not exist, the full token stays visible in red and does nothing.

Use:

```
(Raid Prep)[[AJH23S]]
(Missing Note)[[INVALID]]
```

You can generate a ready-to-paste note link from:

* the Home tab right-click row menu using  `Copy Note Link`
* the Read View  `Link` button

Both produce:

```
(Note Title)[[AJH23S]]
```
